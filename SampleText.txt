Life is an experimental journey undertaken involuntarily. It is a journey 
of the spirit through the material world and, since it is the spirit that 
travels, it is the spirit that is experienced. That is why there exist 
contemplative souls who have lived more intensely, more widely, more 
tumultuously than others who have lived their lives purely externally.
